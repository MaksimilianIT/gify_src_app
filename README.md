Page navigation

I applied Navigator.push to navigate between pages, and it is perfectly okay, but I also discovered that the navigation can be approached more professionally with such tools as go_router. I researched it, but I still did not know enough on how to get it to work correctly yet. I would have to spend some additional time to do it and it could potentially break what I already had working, so I left it out.

Checking the network for availability

I have read about the connectivity_plus package to determine whether the device is connected to the internet. I wanted to display a message when the internet is off, but I did not know how to relate it to my current app state. I would have added this afterwards, but I didn't have enough time to do so and ensure that the main app was functioning well first.
